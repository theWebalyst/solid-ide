# solid-ide
A syntax-highlighting editor and file manager for Solid data stores.

NOTE: this fork contains modifications allowing Solid IDE to be hosted on SAFE Network (see http://safenetwork.tech), a secure, anonymous, decentralised internet. The text below is from the original project, but needs updating to reflect use on SAFE.

This app allows you to examine and manage files in a Solid pod.
It is build with the solid-file-client, vue.js and uses the Ace/Cloud9 editor with syntax highlighting for turtle, n3,
HTML, Javascript, CSS, and many other formats and key bindings for emacs,
vim, and vanilla system editing keys.

You can use the app online (at https://jeff-zucker.github.io/solid-ide/), or, you can download and use a local version.
  The local version can be run from a simple file URL - it does not require (but can be used with) either a local Solid server or a local HTTPD server.

More help is available in the app itself.
